"""직인/관인 placement compliance (M2 P3 / FR-003).

A Korean official document's seal (직인/관인) is placed *by rule*: its **center**
must sit on the **last glyph of the 발신명의** line (the issuer-name line, e.g.
``"행정안전부장관 홍길동"``). This module decides that rule **geometrically**
against the Hancom render boxes — reusing the word-box oracle
(:mod:`hwpx.form_fit.wordbox`) rather than guessing from the document model, since
the truth is where Hancom *drew* the glyph, not where the XML nominally puts it.

Pure-geometry decision entry points (slice 1), offline-testable:

* :func:`find_seal_anchor` — locate the last glyph of the 발신명의 line in a set of
  glyph boxes (the seal's intended center).
* :func:`check_seal_placement` — given a placed seal's box, decide pass/fail: the
  seal center within ``tol`` of the anchor, and no *unintended* occlusion of other
  text. The check **discriminates** (a centered seal passes, a mis-placed one
  fails) so an evaluator can run it — FR-003 / acceptance #3.

Placement entry points (slice 2) — turn the decision into an actual seal:

* :func:`seal_pos_offsets` — map an anchor center (PDF pt) to the PAPER-relative
  ``<hp:pos>`` offsets (HWPUNIT) that land a seal's *center* on it.
* :func:`place_seal` — embed a seal image and attach it as a **floating** picture
  to the source 발신명의 paragraph (``add_picture`` is inline-only), so it lands on
  that paragraph's page at the computed absolute position.

All render coordinates are PDF points (the unit the wordbox oracle reports), origin
top-left (y grows downward). HWPX positions are HWPUNIT (7200 per inch), so a PDF
point is exactly ``100`` HWPUNIT (``7200 / 72``).
