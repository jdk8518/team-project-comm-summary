-- Mac Hancom (한컴오피스 한글) render backend for the VisualComplete oracle.
--
-- This build of Hancom Office HWP (com.hancom.office.hwp12.mac.general) ships
-- NO AppleScript dictionary (sdef) and NO headless convert CLI, so PDF export is
-- GUI-only. This script drives that GUI deterministically through System Events
-- (UI scripting), the Mac analogue of the Windows COM backend (_render_hwpx.ps1).
--
-- Flow, anchored on STABLE MENU-ITEM NAMES (prefix match), not pixels:
--   open <input>  ->  파일 (File) > "PDF로 저장하기..."  ->  NSSavePanel
--   -> Return (= the default 저장 button)  ->  파일 > "문서 닫기"
--
-- Why no typing is needed: the save panel is document-relative — it pre-fills
--   위치 (location) = the input file's directory and the name field = the input
--   stem. The Python caller therefore STAGES the input as <out_dir>/<out_stem>.hwpx,
--   so pressing 저장 writes exactly <out_dir>/<out_stem>.pdf. The caller also
--   pre-deletes the target, so the "대치(replace)?" sheet never appears in normal
--   operation; it is still dismissed defensively here. A "문서 닫기" save-changes
--   prompt is likewise discarded (we only exported; the doc is unmodified).
--
-- Usage:  osascript _render_hwpx_mac.applescript <input.hwpx> <out.pdf> [timeoutSecs]
-- Output: prints "OK" on success; prints "ERR: <reason>" and exits 1 otherwise.
